## About this Project

This is a game I made from a tutorial I will link [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0). Most of the assets I pulled from the tutorial, however I did add my own movement/mechanics as well as designed most of the level myself. 

## Disclaimers

At the time of May 14th 2025 most of the game is in an unfinished state and is uploaded here so that the work that has been done on the game can be seen. Level 1 is mostly playable however if you get to level 2 you will see that it is unfinished. As of right now I have the executable for the project already built onto the github. This executable should run on most windows machines without any issues. In the future as I do more to work on this project and make it more complete I will most likely require that users that want to play the game export themselves inside of godot if they are trying to build this project from this repository. 

## How to run 

I added the executable to this project which is bad form a bit, however I wanted to make sure that it could be run just by cloning the repo. I will note that the executable will only run on windows so if you are not on windows and you attempt to play this game then it will not work. 

in order to run please type the following commands in your terminal once you navigate to the root directory of this project

```bash
./"New Game Project.exe"
```

This should run the game. If you don't see any prompts when you open up the game please hit enter, that should take you to a welcome screen

## Thank you!

Thank you for checking out this tutorial game I made with the help of Brackeys! I should note that this game was made mostly for the purposes of learning godot and figuring out how navigate game design/creation.
